🖼️ Image to Base64 Encoder API (Go)

A simple backend service built in Go that accepts image uploads and converts them into Base64 encoded strings via an HTTP API.
This project demonstrates file handling, binary data processing, encoding, and REST API design.

🚀 Features

Upload image files using multipart/form-data

Convert image binary data to Base64

Return Base64 string as JSON response

Supports JPG / PNG images

Single-file, minimal backend design

Easy to test with browser or HTML

🧠 Why Base64 Encoding?

Base64 encoding is commonly used when:

Sending images inside JSON APIs

Transferring files via webhooks

Embedding images in HTML or emails

Mobile app data synchronization

This project demonstrates how backend systems handle binary → text encoding safely.
